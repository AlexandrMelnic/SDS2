# SDS2
Final project for the course Statistical methods for data science 2

The project is about the analysis of a dataset containing information about FEV (lung capacity), age, and information about smoking or not. The objective is to use a bayesian regression technique to estimate the FEV of a person given the other two information. The project is divided into parts:
1) Use the Markov Chain to draw random variables from the posterior 
2) Analyse the quality of the chain
3) Inference 
4) Simulation of the data
5) Confront with a frequentist approach
